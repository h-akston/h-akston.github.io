The Human Language Technology program at the [University of Arizona](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/) has been my home for the last 2 years. I am set to graduate with an MS degree in HLT in May 2025.

I hold a BA degree in Translation Studies and an MA degree in Computational Linguistics. My most recent work experience revolved around identifying large languages models that support low-resource languages and benchmarking their performance, as well as working on a scoring system to gauge how affected a given low-resource language is by the digital divide.
